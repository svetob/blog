I am a Gothenburg-based technologist with deep experience building and scaling distributed systems. When not at [Forza Football](https://www.forzafootball.com/) getting done whatever needs getting done, I hack on [open source projects](https://github.com/svetob/), explore nature and learn new things.

Move fast, take risks, release early, keep things simple and be a cheerful spirit.
